# ICDS


ICDS is a Python script that uses Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and requests to download images from a given Instagram post. Simply provide the post link and the main user's username, and the script will extract and download the media content to a designated folder. It leverages web scraping techniques to automate the process, allowing users to easily save media from Instagram posts.
